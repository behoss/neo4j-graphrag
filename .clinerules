# Project Rules for neo4j-graphrag

## File Management
- NEVER create multiple versions of main.py (e.g., main_old.py, main_v2.py, main_with_logging.py)
- There should ONLY be ONE main.py file in the project
- If changes are needed, modify main.py directly
- Never create backup files - use git for version control instead

## Logging
- NO truncation in logs - all content must be logged in full
- Log files should contain complete LLM responses, prompts, and data
- Use markdown format for log files with timestamps

## Code Style
- Use one-liner docstrings only
- Do not add documentation unless explicitly asked
- Log all major operations
- Include error handling with detailed error messages
